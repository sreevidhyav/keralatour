<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athirappilly Falls is situated in AyyampuzhaPanchayat in Aluva Taluk of Ernakulam District near the border of AthirapillyPanchayat in ChalakudyTaluk of Thrissur district of Kerala, India. The major towns near the waterfalls are Chalakudy and Angamaly. The falls are located on the west-flowing Chalakudy River, near the Vazhachal Forest Division and the Sholayar ranges. This 24-metre (80 ft) waterfall and the nearby Vazhachal Falls are popular tourist destinations. There is another waterfall on the way from Athirappilly to Vazhachal Falls, in close proximity to the road and is locally called "Charpa Falls". Athirappilly Falls is the largest waterfall in Kerala and is nicknamed "The Niagara of India". Controversy about a state-proposed hydroelectric dam on the Chalakudy River above the waterfalls began in the 1990s and has continued through 2011.
